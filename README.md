        ![Sign Up Hero Image Colour Palette](assets/images/color-palette-sign-up.png)
    
    -   #### Typography

        -   The 'Hubballi' and 'Mina' fonts are used across the site, with  Hubballi being used for the body text and Mina for the h1, h2, h3 heading. These fonts were chosen as they resemble the in-game fonts fairly closely, as seen by the [Horizon Zero Dawn Logo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Logo_Horizon_Zero_Dawn.svg):
        
            ![Horizon Zero Dawn Logo](assets/images/logo-horizon-zero-dawn.png)
    
    -   #### Imagery

        -   Each page has its own hero image to immediately immerse the user into the breath-taking world of the Horizon games - whether it be existing fans of the games or newcomers coming to learn more about the world of Horizon. They are all in-game shots and thus allow the user to imagine themselves in the Horizon universe. 

        -   The other images on the page are of the enemeny machines and can be found on the Machine Catalogue page. These images have been selected specifically as they show the machines on their own, without any other characters or other machines, so as to make clear to the user which machine is being described. They are also good-quality, in-game images to give the user the feeling of experiencing the game directly.

### ***Further Testing***

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge browsers.

-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop up to 28 inch screen with 4k resolution, Laptop, Pixel 3a, Pixel 4, Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e.

-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### ***Known Bugs***

-   On some mobile devices, notably the Pixel 3a the form fieldset on the Sign Up page pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page. A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result. However, this issue does not appear on [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools) or [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/)
