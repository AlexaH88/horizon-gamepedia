<h1 align="center">Horizon Gaming Community Website</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://alexah88.github.io/portfolio-project-1/)

The Horizon Gaming Community website has been developed for all the Horizon game franchise (Zero Dawn and Forbidden West) fans out there. The user can join the site's community to connect with fellow gaming nerds, view the machine catalogue to get tips on how to defeat the machines in the games, and read up about the history of the games and how they were developed by the game studio Guerrilla Games.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are darkslategray #373e46 and darksalmon #cd9479 and were chosen from the two hero images below, all the while taking into account their compatibility with the other two hero images on the page. 
        ![About The Games Hero Image](assets/images/hero-image-about-the-games.jpg)
        ![Game Developer History Hero Image](assets/images/hero-image-developer-history.jpg)
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
