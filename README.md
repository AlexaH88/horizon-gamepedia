[View the live project here.](https://alexah88.github.io/portfolio-project-1/)

The Horizon Gaming Community website has been developed for all the Horizon game franchise (Zero Dawn and Forbidden West) fans out there.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are darkslategray #373e46 and darksalmon #cd9479 and were chosen from the two hero images below, all the while taking into account their compatibility with the other two hero images on the page. 
        ![About The Games Hero Image](assets/images/hero-image-about-the-games.jpg)
        ![Game Developer History Hero Image](assets/images/hero-image-developer-history.jpg)
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  ![Nav Bar](assets/images/nav-bar.png)
  - The navigation bar includes five clickable links, allowing the user to easily access the four pages on the site: 
    - Horizon Gaming Community site name (links to the About The Games home page)
    - About The Games page
    - Game Developer History page
    - Machine Catalogue page
    - Sign Up page
  - In order to make navigation easier for the user, the navigation bar is in a fixed position, meaning that it remains at the top of the page as the user scrolls down. 
  - The navigation bar follows the same style and size as the footer, and appears in the same format on all four pages - this allows for consistency throughout the site. 
  - A hover effect of the text turning white is included, allowing the user to understand that the link is clickable. Once the link has been clicked, the text remains white to indicate to the user which page they find themselves on. 
  - The navigation bar was created with HTML and CSS only and is fully responsive across devices.

1. [Balsamiq:](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - Balsamiq was used to create the [wireframes](https://github.com/) during the design process.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/)
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/)

- Accessibility:
  - [EightShapes Contrast Grid](http://eightshapes.com/) was used to test the colour scheme of the site for any accessibility issues. 
  ![EightShapes Contrast Grid](assets/images/eightshapes-contrast-grid.png)
  - Only AAA and AA rating options were used on the site, other than for the Font Awesome icons on the main page which are #cd9479 on #fff but these accommodate for accessibility by using the aria-hidden="true" attribute as recommended by [Font Awesome's Accessiblity Page](https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/other-topics/accessibility)

        3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

        1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.

        5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
        2. Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
        3. If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.
