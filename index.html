        <!-- about the horizon games franchise in general -->
        <div>
            <p> The Horizon games are action role-playing games played from a third-person view. Players take control of
                Aloy, a hunter
                who ventures through a post-apocalyptic land ruled by robotic creatures. Aloy can kill enemies in a
                variety of ways â€“ setting traps such as tripwires using the Tripcaster, shooting them with arrows,
                using explosives, and a spear. Machine components, including electricity and the metal they are
                composed of, are vital to Aloy's survival; she can loot their remains for crafting resources. Ammo,
                resource satchels, pouches, quivers, resistance, antidotes, health potions, and traps can all be
                crafted. Weapons have modification slots for dealing more damage. Aloy wears a Focus, a small head
                piece that scans machines to determine their susceptibilities, identify their location, their level, and
                the nature of loot they will drop. Machines attack with defensive and offensive measures, and in either
                case
                react to a perceived threat by charging at it with brute force or projectiles. Exhibiting the behaviour
                of
                wild animals, some machines are inclined to move in herds, and others, with the ability to fly, do so in
                flocks. Unless hacked with the Override Tool, or sufficiently hit with corruption arrows, machines do
                not
                exert aggressive force against each other. Aloy also engages in battle with human enemies, such as
                bandits and the Eclipse cult.</p>

            <!-- horizon zero dawn synopsis -->
            <span class="game-synopses">
                <p>The story is set in a post-apocalyptic United States, between the states of Colorado, Wyoming and
                    Utah,
                    in
                    the 31st century. Humans live in scattered, primitive tribes with varying levels of technological
                    development. Their technologically advanced predecessors are remembered as the "Old Ones". Large
                    robotic
                    creatures, known as "machines", dominate the Earth. For the most part, they peacefully coexist with
                    humans,
                    who occasionally hunt them for parts. However, a phenomenon known as the "Derangement" has caused
                    machines
                    to become more aggressive towards humans, and larger and deadlier machines have begun to appear.
                    There
                    are
                    four tribes that are prominently featured: the Nora, the Banuk, the Carja and the Oseram. The Nora
                    are
                    fierce hunter-gatherers who live in the mountains and worship nature as the "All-Mother". The Carja
                    are
                    desert-dwelling city builders who worship the Sun. The Banuk consists of wandering clans made up of
                    hunters
                    and shamans who live in snowy mountains and worship the machines and their "songs". The Oseram are
                    tinkerers
                    and salvagers known for their metalworking, brewing, and talent as warriors.</p>

                <p>Horizon Forbidden West continues the story of Aloy, a young hunter of the Nora tribe, as she leads a
                    band
                    of
                    companions on a quest to the arcane frontier known as the Forbidden West to find the source of a
                    mysterious
                    plague that kills all it infects. On her journey across these uncharted lands, Aloy encounters new
                    regions
                    ravaged by massive storms and deadly machines, and conflicts with a tribe of nomadic raiders who
                    have
                    tamed
                    the machines as war mounts. She discovers a vast array of environments and ecosystems, including
                    lush
                    valleys, dry deserts, snowy mountains, tropical beaches, ruined cities, and underwater settings.</p>
